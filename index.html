			<div>
				<h2><span></span> What is some basic information about me?</h2>
				<p>
					My name is Isaac Terry. I was born in the United States (more specifically, Gary, Indiana). I am a 27-year-old 
					graduate student in electrical and computer engineering at <a href="http://www.iupui.edu" target="_blank"> Indiana University-Purdue 
					University Indianapolis</a> (IUPUI). I am more on the quiet side and often feel that most people cannot relate to me. 
					I tend not to fit in, am unable to find my way, and do not know where I belong in life. I am pursuing hobbies in machine
					learning and web development in order to help me in my search for answers. I am <strong>persistent</strong>, 
					<strong>patient</strong>, <strong>curious</strong>, and <strong>caring</strong>.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2><span></span> What is important to me?</h2>	
				<p>The ability to follow and explore opportunities for self-growth is important to me. This involves four things (in no particular order):</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Obtaining the education and training needed to accomplish important tasks to me</li>
					<li>Having supportive people who keep me honest and give advice when I am lost</li> 
					<li>Being in a career that allows having a flexible work schedule and working with many of the latest technologies</li>
					<li>Finding a way to help make lives of others at least a little more easier</li>

				<h2><span></span> Why am I doing web development?</h2>
				<p>
					I started my journey into web development in July of this year. My only experience right now is with 
					front-end web development. I plan on learning back-end web development around the beginning of 2016. 
					My interest in building websites is about me trying to learn something new. I want to express and push myself to 
					see what I can do and where I belong. It is nice to learn how to create webpages since I use them everyday. Learning web 
					development is a challenging task. To gain the skills that I need to do web development, I am using a variety of resources. 
					The most essential are <a href="https://www.thinkful.com" target="_blank">Thinkful</a>, 
					<a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com" target="_blank">Free Code Camp</a>, and 
					<a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/full-stack" target="_blank">Coursera's Full Stack Web Developent Specialization</a>
					because I like the structure they provide the most.

			<h1><span></span> Me and Machine Learning</h1>
			<div>
				<h2><span></span> Why am I doing machine learning?</h2>
				<p>
					I started my journey into machine learning in December of 2013. It has been difficult for me. Thus far, my favorite resources
					have been <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/analytics-edge-mitx-15-071x-0" target="_blank">MITx's The Analytics Edge</a>,
					Dr. Andrew Ng's machine learning courses (<a href="https://see.stanford.edu/Course/CS229" target="_blank">Stanford</a>, 
					<a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning" target="_blank">Coursera</a>), and the book
					<a href="http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/" target="_blank"><em>An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R</em></a>.
					However, I only actually completed the first one. I have tried so many resources and have been unable to get a strong enough grasp on
					machine leaning in order to understand how to use it. Most resources have either been too focused on application and a little theory 
					or too focused on theory and a little on the applications. I have not been able to find the right balance, but I really want to do 
					machine learning. I want to learn from data because of the potential ability to improve the lives of others and transform organizations'
					productivity. I find the idea of making fairly accurate predictions on uncertain outcomes using data exciting. I would like to have the
					ability to be depended upon to analyze data to answer questions that an organization may have.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2><span></span> How will I continue developing my machine learning journey?</h2>
				<p>
					Everytime I begin using a resource to develop my machine learning skills, I feel that I have finally found the right resource for me.
					I turn out to be wrong, but I feel that I can now break that barrier. I will now be enrolling in 
					<a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning" target="_blank">Coursera's Machine Learning Specialization</a> and 
					using the book 
					<a href="https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/mastering-predictive-analytics-r"><em>Mastering Predictive Analytics with R</em></a>.

			<h2>How would I describe myself?</h2>
			<p>
				I am a graduate student in electrical and computer engineering at <a href="http://www.iupui.edu">
				Indiana University - Purdue University Indianapolis</a> (IUPUI). I am more on the quiet side and 
				do not socialize much with others because I do not tend to fit in. I am <strong>persistent</strong>, <strong>patient</strong>, 
				and <strong>empathetic</strong>.
			</p>
			<p>
				The ability to follow and explore opportunities for self-growth is important to me. 
				This involves two things:
				<ul>
					<li>Obtaining the education and training needed to accomplish important tasks.</li>
					<li>Having supportive people who keep me honest and give advice when I am lost.</li> 
				</ul>

			<h2>Why am I doing front-end web development?</h2>
			<p>
				My interest in building websites is about me trying to learn something new. I want to express and
				push myself to see what I can do in developing websites. Creating websites will help me better 
				understand something I use everyday. I want to go from only being a user to being a creator. I am 
				using both <a href="https://www.thinkful.com" target="_blank">Thinkful</a> and 
				<a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com" target="_blank">Free Code Camp</a> to accomplish this.
			</p>
			<p>
				My Thinkful projects:
				<ol>
					<li><a href="">Experiment with Chrome Developer Tools</a></li>
					<li><a href="">Build a Landing Page</a></li>
				</ol>
